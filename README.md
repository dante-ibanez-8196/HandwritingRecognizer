# HandwritingRecognizer
An Artificial Neural Network that takes in an ungodly CSV file to make it learn statistically.

# Running the program
I compiled and ran this program on Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor with necessary Java plugins and extensions.
If you are running this program on a zsh or unix terminal, type
`javac Source.java` to compile the program and `java Source.java` to
run the program assuming you have clone this repository.

# Requirements
- Handwritten Data CSV file downloaded and kept in the same directory
as the main Java file. If you choose to keep the CSV file elsewhere, make sure to update the file path of the File object or the program will throw an exception.
